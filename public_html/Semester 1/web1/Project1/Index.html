                        <figcaption>Another thing I love to do the most is to travel. I always had the passion of traveling and getting to explore many countries around the world. Mainly would be in Europe and the middle east regions. Also, I have the interest into working as a travel agent in order to book flights for people traveling to different countries around the world.  </figcaption>

                        <figcaption>One of the main things I use every day on my smartphone is social media. Social media has made me able to share and create contents I like using many apps such as Facebook,Instagram and twitter. It also allows me to be able to stay in touch with family and loved one using many platforms like WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger. Also, thanks to YouTube I get to watch many videos everyday for entertainment stuff and it brings suggestions based on the content I watch on its platform every day. I have always had the biggest interest and passion to work in many fields for social media such as being a social media associate, social media manager or social media marketer. </figure>
